			icon static assets (with exception of the icons that are being used by the library itself). 
			
			Setting the property 'PublishFluentIconAssets' to 'true' will enable publishing of the icon static assets. You can limit what icon assets 
			get published by specifying icon sizes and variants in the 'FluentIconSizes' and 'FluentIconVariants' properties respectively.
			
			To determine what icons will be published, the specified options for sizes and variants are combined. Specifying sizes '10' and '16' and 
			variants 'Filled' and 'Regular' means all '10/Filled', all '10/Regular', all '16/Filled' and all '16/Regular' icons assets will be published. 
			It is not posible to specify multiple individual combinations like '10/Filled' and '16/Regular' in the same set.
