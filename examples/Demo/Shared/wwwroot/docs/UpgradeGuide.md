## Breaking changes v4.8.0

The `Option<TType>`-type is a utility class that can be used to define list of options that are presented in a `FluentSelect` or any of the other list components. We have [examples of showing how this work](https://www.fluentui-blazor.net/Select#fromalistofoptiontit) available on the demo site.

Originally, the `Text` property in this class was of type `TType?`. We've changed this in this release so that this property is now of type `string?`, which, we think, makes much more sense. (The `Value` property of this type remains as-is (`TType?`).)

If you are using this type, you'll most probably need to make some (small and simple) changes in your code after upgrading to this version.

## Breaking changes v4.7.0

Most projects add `@using Microsoft.FluentUI.AspNetCore.Components` to `_Imports.razor`. To avoid conflicts with existing methods in other
libraries, we've decided to place all our extension methods in an **Extensions** (sub)namespace. This can be a **minor breaking-change** which
requires you to just add an new `using` statement for the new namespace to fix any errors.

For existing projects:
1. Add `@using Microsoft.FluentUI.AspNetCore.Components.Extensions` to `_Imports.razor` file.
2. Add `using Microsoft.FluentUI.AspNetCore.Components.Extensions` to the top of the C# files where you use the extension methods.

In the case of a conflict, you can remove these lines to distinguish the methods of **FluentUI.AspNetCore.Components** from those of other libraries.

## Breaking changes v4.0.0
The most obvious breaking change of course is namespace change from 
`Microsoft.Fast.Components.FluentUI` to `Microsoft.FluentUI.AspNetCore.Components`. 
This means you will need to change all `usings` in your code, change your `_Imports.razor`, etc.

- You no longer need to specify any `HostingModel` in the `AddFluentUIComponents()` service collection extension. If it is still in there, remove it.
- AfterBindValue has been replaced with the native @bind-Value:after
- FluentToast: Timeout is now in milliseconds
- FluentToastContainer renamed to FluentToastProvider
- FluentMessageBarContainer renamed to FluentMessageBarProvider
- FluentButton: `Appearance.Filled` is no longer a valid value.
- Removed the FluentCodeEditor component

The rest of the changes are minimal. Check the [WhatsNew](/WhatsNew) page for more information.

### Upgrading your VS solution from v3 to v4
When upgrading your solution in Visual Studio from `Microsoft.Fast.Components.FluentUI` (v3.x) to `Microsoft.FluentUI.AspNetCore.Components` (v4.x)
you might run into an issue where the Razor editor is not working properly anymore. You will see a lot of errors in your razor files and IntelliSense is not working.

We found following 4 steps gets you to a working environment again:
1. Close Visual Studio
1. Delete `bin` and `obj` folders from all projects in your solution
1. Remove the folder `X:\Users\<user>\.nuget\packages\microsoft.fast.components.fluentui` (where 'X' denotes the drive you store your user folder)
1. Restart Visual Studio and rebuild you project


## Breaking changes v3.2.0

### The pre-v3.2 `FluentNavMenu` has been renamed to `FluentNavMenuTree` 
A new `FluentNavMenu` component has been added. 

If you want to **upgrade** your previous menu code, the following changes need to be made:

* Change all occurrences of `<FluentNavMenuLink>` to `<FluentNavLink>`
* Change `FluentNavMenuLink` from a self-closing tag to a tag with a closing tag
* Move the `FluentNavMenuLink` `Text` parameter content to in between the opening and closing tag
* Change any `@onclick` occurrences to `OnClick`

* Change all occurrences of `FluentNavMenuGroup` to `FluentNavGroup'
* Replace the `Text` parameter with `Title`

If you want to **keep** your previous menu code, the following change needs to be made:
* Rename `FluentNavMenu` to `FluentNavMenuTree`
 

## Breaking changes v3.0.0
The `FluentDataGrid` component is, as you may know, a `QuickGrid` in disguise. We 
aligned the underlying code even more to the productized version that will ship with 
.NET 8. Where we previously aligned parameter names to the `fluent-datagrid` Web 
Component, we will now align to the `QuickGrid` naming. This should make 
integrating/copying `QuickGrid` component examples in your own environment easier and 
will make it easier for us to keep the code up-to-date. Changes that need to be made in parameter names from v2 are:  
* RowsData -> Items 
* RowsDataProvider -> ItemsProvider 
* RowsDataSize -> ItemSize 
* RowsDataKey -> ItemKey	

Another breaking change is found in the `Align` enumeration. Where we previously used the values `Left` and `Right`, these have now been changed to `Start` and `End`. This to make working with those easier/more consistent in an RTL-based application.
 
`FluentBadge` now uses a `Color` \ `BackgroundColor` combination to determine the fill values.
 
`FluentCalendar` no longer wraps the `fluent-calendar` web component. Its functionality was too limited. Not all parameters are supported in the updated version.
 
`StackHorizontalAlignment`/`StackVerticalAlignment` have been renamed to just `HorizontalAlignment`/`VerticalAlignment` as there are now more components using these enumarations.

## FluentComponentBase changes
The `FluentComponentBase` class now has an `Id` parameter. This has been lifted from the `FluentInputBase` class. 
The `Id` parameter is used to set the `id` attribute on the root element of the component. 
Previously, in the `FluentInputBase` class, a value was always created for the `Id`. This is no longer the case and 
a value is now only created for components that need to have an id. If needed, you can assign an value to the `Id` 
parameter yourself which will then be used as the 'id' on the root element.

## When using icons or emoji in version 2
We have changed the way icons and emoji are used in version 3. We published a [Icons](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Fast.Components.FluentUI.Icons) NuGet package
and a [Emoji](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Fast.Components.FluentUI.Emojis) NuGet package.   
The Fluent UI System Icons are a (still growing) collection of familiar, friendly and modern icons from Microsoft.
At the moment there are more than 2200 distinct icons available in both filled and outlined versions and in various sizes. In total the collections consists of well over 11k icons in SVG format.

After the following changes, usage is very simple:
```xml
<FluentIcon Value="@(new Icons.Regular.Size24.Save())" />
```

There are a couple of changes that need to be done to upgrade from v2 to v3 when using icons/emoji:

### 1. Changes in `.csproj` file
For version 2 you needed to add a `<ProjectGroup>` similar to below to your project file:
```xml
<PropertyGroup>
	<PublishFluentIconAssets>true</PublishFluentIconAssets>
	<FluentIconSizes>10,12,16,20,24,28,32,48</FluentIconSizes>
	<FluentIconVariants>Filled,Regular</FluentIconVariants>
	<PublishFluentEmojiAssets>true</PublishFluentEmojiAssets>
	<FluentEmojiGroups>Activities,Animals_Nature,Flags,Food_Drink,Objects,People_Body,Smileys_Emotion,Symbols,Travel_Places</FluentEmojiGroups>
	<FluentEmojiStyles>Color,Flat,HighContrast</FluentEmojiStyles>
</PropertyGroup>
```
This whole group should be **removed** from your project file. See the [Project setup](https://www.fluentui-blazor.net/ProjectSetup)
for instructions on how to work with icons and emoji in version 3.

### 2. Changes in `Program.cs`
The `AddFluentUIComponents()` service collection extension needs to be changed. 
The `options.IconConfiguration` and `options.EmojiConfiguration` lines are no longer necessary and should be removed.

```csharp
builder.Services.AddFluentUIComponents(options =>
{
    options.HostingModel = {see remark below};   
});
```

The `options.HostingModel` setting is used to determine the type of project you are building. Choose a value from the `BlazorHostingModel` enumeration which reflects your type of project.

### 3. Changes in code
**ALL** occurences of `<FluentIcon>` and `<FluentEmoji>` should be checked and changed to work with the new format.

For icons the new format is like:
 
```razor
<FluentIcon Value="@(new @(Icons.Regular.Size24.Save)())" />
```

> Names are structured as follows: `Icons.[IconVariant].[IconSize].[IconName]`.

For emoji the new format is:

```xml
<FluentEmoji Value="@(new Emojis.PeopleBody.Color.Default.Artist())" />
```

> Names are structured as follows: `Emojis.[EmojiGroup].[EmojiStyle].[EmojiSkintone].[EmojiName]`.

ðŸ“¢ You can automate the changes by using the [Visual Studio Find and Replace functionality](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/using-regular-expressions-in-visual-studio).

> Before to use **Find and Replace in Files**, you have to backup your project.
> The following steps are provided as an example and may not work in your case.
> You have to adapt them to your project.

- To search: `<FluentIcon Name="?@?FluentIcons\.(?<name>[^"]+)"? Size="?@?IconSize\.(?<size>[^"]+)"? Variant="?@?IconVariant\.(?<variant>[^"]+)"? Color="?@?Color\.(?<color>[^"]+)"? Slot="?(?<slot>[^"]+)"? />`
- To replace by: `<FluentIcon Value="@(new Icons.${variant}.${size}.${name}())" Color="@Color.${color}" Slot="${slot}" />`

![Find and Replace](./_content/FluentUI.Demo.Shared/images/Icons-FindReplace-RegEx.png)

The preceding expressions are defined to search for attributes in this order: Name, Size, Variant, Color, Slot.
You may need to change or delete some attributes, depending on how you've coded them (and relaunch the process).

## Using the library from a RCL
For version 2 you had to add the following to your project file:
```xml
<Target Name="DisableAnalyzers" BeforeTargets="CoreCompile">
	<ItemGroup>
		<Analyzer Remove="@(Analyzer)" Condition="'%(Filename)' == 'Microsoft.Fast.Components.FluentUI.Configuration'" />
	</ItemGroup>
</Target>
```
This is no longer necessary. The code should be **removed** from your project file
