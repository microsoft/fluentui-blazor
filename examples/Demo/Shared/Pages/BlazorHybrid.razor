<h1>Blazor Hybrid</h1>

<p>
    It is possible to use this library in your Blazor Hybrid projects. Setup is almost the same as described in the "Getting started" section above,
    however to get everything to work you'll need to take one extra step:
</p>

<h3 id="temporary-workaround-for-mauiwpfwindows-forms-issues">Temporary workaround for MAUI/WPF/Windows Forms issues</h3>
<p>
    Currently when using WebView to run Blazor (in all Hybrid variants), the web-components script is not imported automatically (see <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-blazor/issues/404">#404</a>).
    There is also an issue with loading the custom event handlers that are being configured by the web-components script. Until these are fixed on the WebView side, there is
    a workaround available, namely to intercept '_framework/blazor.modules.json' and provide proper JS initializers (created by the build). The needed script is
    included in the general library script and needs to be included with a script tag <strong>before</strong> the <code>_framework/blazor.webview.js</code> script tag.
</p>

<CodeSnippet Language="html">
    @(
@"<script app-name=""{NAME OF YOUR APP}"" src=""./_content/Microsoft.FluentUI.AspNetCore.Components/js/initializersLoader.webview.js""></script>
<script src=""_framework/blazor.webview.js""></script>"
    )
</CodeSnippet>

<p>
    The <code>app-name</code> attribute needs to match your app's assembly name - the script uses 'app-name' to resolve the name of the file with initializers.
    The 'initializersLoader' part of the script replaces the standard <code>fetch</code> function with one which provides the correct file in place of the empty <code>blazor.modules.json</code>. <code>fetch</code> is restored to its original state once the <code>_framework/blazor.modules.json</code> request is intercepted.
