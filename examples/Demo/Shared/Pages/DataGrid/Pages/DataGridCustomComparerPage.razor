        <p>
            Here a custom comparer is being used to sort counties by the length of their name. The code has examples for both
            <code>PropertyColumn</code> and <code>TemplateColumn</code> implementations (see the Razor tab).<br />
            For this example the code for the comparer is placed in the <code>DataGridCustomComparer.razor.cs</code> file but it
            could of course be placed in its own file.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the paginator, this example also shows how to use the <code>SummaryTemplate</code> and <code>PaginationTextTemplate</code> parameters.
        </p>
        <p>
            This example also shows using an <code>OnRowFocus</code> event callback to detect which row the cursor is over. By setting <code>ShowHover</code>
            to true, the current row will be highlighted. By default the system will use the designated hover color for this but you can specify an alternative
            color by setting the <code>--datagrid-hover-color</code> CSS variable. See the Razor tab for how this is done in this example.
