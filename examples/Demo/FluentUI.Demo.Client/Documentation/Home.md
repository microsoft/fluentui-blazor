# Welcome to the FluentUI Blazor documentation

The **Fluent UI Blazor** library provides a robust and extensive set of [Blazor](https://blazor.net/) components.
Some of those components are wrappers around Microsoft's official Fluent UI Web Components.
Others are components that leverage the [Fluent Design System](https://fluent2.microsoft.design/)
or just make it easier to work with **Fluent** in general.

To get up and running with the **Microsoft.FluentUI.AspNetCore.Components** library,
see the **"Getting Started"** section below.
