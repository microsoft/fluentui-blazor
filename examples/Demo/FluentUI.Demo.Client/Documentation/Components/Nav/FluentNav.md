# Nav

A `NavItem` or a `NavSubItem` can contain either an `Href` or an `OnClick` handler.

In the example below, the first (and third and fifth) item has an `Href` that navigates to an external site, while the second (and fourth) item has an `OnClick` handler that triggers a method in the component.
{{ NavDefault }}
