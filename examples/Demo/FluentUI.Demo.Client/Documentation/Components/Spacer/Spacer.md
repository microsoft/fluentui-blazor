# Spacer
The purpose of this component is to generate space between other components. You can either create
a space with a set width (in number of pixels) or create a space with a flexible width.

## Default
By default, the spacer will set a flex growth of '1' to fill any space it can compared to other elements in the flex container.

{{ SpacerDefault }}

## Width in pixels
If specifying the width parameters in pixels, the spacer will be a <span> element with a inline width of that amount of pixels.

{{ SpacerWidth }}
