# MessageBar

Communicates important information about the state of the entire application or surface.
For example, the status of a page, panel, dialog or card.
The information shouldn't require someone to take immediate action, but should persist until
the user performs one of the required actions.

## Appearance

**FluentMessageBar** components come built-in with preset intents that determine the design and aria live announcement.

{{ MessageBarAppearance }}

## Actions

The **FluentMessageBar** can have different actions.
