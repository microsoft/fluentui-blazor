# Card

A **FluentCard** is a container that holds information and actions related to a single concept or object, like a document or a contact.

Cards can give information prominence and create predictable patterns.
While they're very flexible, it's important to use them consistently for particular use cases across experiences.

By default, each card is of `role="group"`.

## Appearance

Cards can have different styles depending on the situation and where it is placed.

{{ CardAppearanceExample }}

## Shadow

Cards can have shadows to create a sense of depth and separation from the background.

{{ CardShadowExample }}

## Clickable

Adding a `OnClick` handler to a card will make it clickable, which is useful for navigation or actions.

{{ CardClickable }}

## Examples

Cards can be composed with other components to build rich elements for a page.
