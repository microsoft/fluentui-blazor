    <b>Default</b>
    <FluentCard>
        This is the default style to use for cards. Use this style variant for most of your card designs.
    </FluentCard>

    <br />

    <b>Filled</b>
    <FluentCard Appearance="@CardAppearance.Filled">
        Use if your card is being displayed on a lighter gray or white surface. <br />
        This ensures that you have adequate contrast between the card surface and the background of the application.
    </FluentCard>

    <br />

    <b>Outline</b>
    <FluentCard Appearance="@CardAppearance.Outline">
        Use when you don't want a filled background color but a discernable outline (border) on the card.
    </FluentCard>

    <br />

    <b>Subtle</b>
    <FluentCard Appearance="@CardAppearance.Subtle">
        This variant doesn't have a background or border for the card container.<br />
        However, it does include interaction states that display a visible footprint when interacting with the card item.
    </FluentCard>
