# Paginator

The `FluentPaginator` component is used to display a set of pages for
navigating through a collection of items. It is mostly being used in
combination with a `FluentDataGrid`. See the examples on the [DataGrid](/DataGrid)
page for more information.

_At a later date, point to example usage on Icon/Emoji explore  as well_
