# TextArea

A **FluentTextArea** component enables a user to enter multiple lines of text.
The component is a wrapper for the <fluentui-textarea /> web component.

## Appearance

The apparent style of a textarea can be changed by setting the `Appearance` and `Size` properties.

You can also add a label to the text input by setting the `Label` property and a placeholder by setting the `Placeholder` property.
The label will be automatically positioned above the text input, and the placeholder will be displayed inside the text input.

We recommend to use a spacing of 24px between text fields and other components.

{{ TextAreaAppearances }}

## Resize

The `Resize` property allows you to specify how the textarea can be resized by the user.

{{ TextAreaResizes }}

## Binding with ImmediateDelay

In some cases, you may want to bind the value of the text input to a property of a model
and update the model immediately after the user types a character. But you may also want to delay the update.

This can be achieved by setting the `Immediate` and the (optional) `ImmediateDelay` properties.

{{ TextAreaImmediate }}

## States

A text input can be in different states, such as `Disabled`, `ReadOnly`, and `Required`.

{{ TextAreaState }}

## Know restrictions

At this time, it's not possible to define the height and width of the component.

> These features are under investigation.
