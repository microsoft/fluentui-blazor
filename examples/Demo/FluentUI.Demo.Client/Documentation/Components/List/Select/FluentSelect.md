# Select

The `Select` component allows one option to be selected from multiple options.

## TEST

Only use one **primary** button in a layout for the most important action.
If there are more than two buttons with equal priority, all buttons should have neutral backgrounds.

When there are many available minor actions, use the **outline**, **subtle**, or **transparent** appearances
on all buttons to avoid a busy layout.
