# List components

List components are used to display a collection of items. We currently provide the following list components:
- [FluentSelect](/Lists/Select): A dropdown list that allows users to select one or more options from a predefined list.
- [FluentCombobox](/Lists/Combobox): A combination of a dropdown list and an input field that allows users to select from a list or enter their own value.
