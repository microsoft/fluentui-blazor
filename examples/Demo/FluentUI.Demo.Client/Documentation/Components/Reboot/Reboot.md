# Reboot CSS

Reboot is a collection of element-specific CSS changes in a single file to help kickstart building a site
with the **FluentUI Blazor library**. It provides an elegant, consistent, and simple baseline to build upon
(inspired by [Bootstrap's Reboot](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/content/reboot/) which again is based
on [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css))

If you want to use **Reboot**, like this demo site, you'll need to include it in your `App.razor`
or `index.html` file like this:

```html
<link href="_content/Microsoft.FluentUI.AspNetCore.Components/css/reboot.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

If you are creating a site by using our [Templates package](https://www.fluentui-blazor.net/Templates),
this is already set up for you. You can [download the file](https://www.fluentui-blazor.net/_content/Microsoft.FluentUI.AspNetCore.Components/css/reboot.css)
to see what's inside.

PS: It is entirely possible to build a site **without using Reboot** but you will have to do more styling yourself.
