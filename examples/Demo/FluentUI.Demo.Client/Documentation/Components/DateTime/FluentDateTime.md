# Date and Time pickers

The `FluentCalendar` is an implementation of a month calendar display leveraging the Fluent UI design system.
It allows for setting selected and/or disabled dates and can handle a click on a day event (if not ReadOnly)

The `FluentDatePicker` is an input field that shows a calendar dropdown to select a date.

The `FluentTimePicker` allows for picking a specific time of day by selecting hour, minutes and AM/PM

> [!Note]
> The FluentCalendar and FluentDatePicker components are not yet fully compatible with the EditForm and FluentEditForm elements.
> Some functionalities, such as error messages, the requirement message or the validation messages are missing.
