# DataGrid

The DataGrid is actually comprised of several components and used to display tabular data. The `<FluentDataGrid>` component is the most important
component and is the one normally put onto a page. Internally it uses the`<FluentDataGridRow>` and `<FluentDataGridCell>` components to build up
the grid. It is possible (technically speaking) to use these components manually, but that is **not** the recommended way of working with the DataGrid.

## Rendering
The DataGrid uses standard HTML table elements for rendering the grid. It supports 2 different display modes through the `DisplayMode`
parameter: `DataGridDisplayMode.Grid` (default) and `DataGridDisplayMode.Table`.
- With the `Grid` mode, the `GridTableColumns` parameter can be
used to specify column widths in fractions. It basically provides an HTML table element with a `display: grid;` style.
- With the `Table` mode, it uses standard HTML table elements and rendering. Column widths are best specified through the `Width` parameter on the columns.

> [!NOTE]
Specifically when using `Virtualize`, it is **highly recommended** to use the `Table` display mode as the `Grid` mode can exhibit odd scrolling behavior.


## Accessibility

You can use the <kbd>Arrow</kbd> keys to navigate through a DataGrid. When a header cell is focused and the column is sortable, you can use the
<kbd>Tab</kbd> key to select the sort button. Pressing the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key will toggle the sorting direction. Pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd>
removes the column sorting and restores the default/start situation with regards to sorting. *You cannot remove the default grid sorting with
this key combination*.

When a header cell is focused and the column allows setting options, you can use the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key to select the options button. Pressing
the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key then will toggle the options popover. Pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd> closes the popover .

When a grid allows resizing of the columns, you can use the <kbd>+</kbd> and <kbd>-</kbd> keys to resize the column the focused header belongs
to. Incrementing/decrementing width is done in steps of 10 pixels at a time. You can reset to the original initial column widths by pressing
<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>r</kbd>.

When a row cell is focused, the grid contains a `SelectColumn` (with `SelectFromEntireRow` parameter set to `true` (default)), you can use the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to select or unselect the current
row.

## Sorting

The DataGrid supports sorting by clicking on the column headers (when the `HeaderCellAsButtonWithMenu` parameter is `false` (default)). The default sort direction is ascending. Clicking on the same column header
again will toggle the sort direction. When `HeaderCellAsButtonWithMenu` is true, a menu will be used to get trigger the sorting action.

A sort can be removed by right clicking (or by pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>r</kbd>) on the header column (with exception of
the default sort).

## Row size

The DataGrid offers a `RowSize` parameter which allows you to use different preset row heights. The value uses the `DataGridRowSize`
enumeration for its type. When using `Virtualize`, the `ItemSize` value **must** still be used to indicate the row height.

## Change strings used in the UI

The DataGrid has a number of strings that are used in the UI. These can be changed by leveraging the built-in [localization](/localization) functionality.
The following values can be localized:

- DataGrid_EmptyContent
- DataGrid_OptionsMenu
- DataGrid_ResizeDiscrete
- DataGrid_ResizeExact
- DataGrid_ResizeGrow
- DataGrid_ResizeMenu
- DataGrid_ResizeReset
- DataGrid_ResizeShrink
- DataGrid_ResizeSubmit
- DataGrid_SelectColumn_AllChecked
- DataGrid_SelectColumn_AllIndeterminate
- DataGrid_SelectColumn_AllUnchecked
- DataGrid_SelectColumn_RowChecked
- DataGrid_SelectColumn_RowUnchecked
- DataGrid_SortMenu
- DataGrid_SortMenuAscending
- DataGrid_SortMenuDescending
- DataGrid_ToggleNesting


## Using the DataGrid component with EF Core

If you want to use the `FluentDataGrid` with data provided through EF Core, you need to install an additional package so the grid knows how to resolve queries asynchronously for efficiency.

### Installation
Install the package by running the command:

```cshtml
dotnet add package Microsoft.FluentUI.AspNetCore.Components.DataGrid.EntityFrameworkAdapterCopy
```

### Usage
In your `Program.cs` file you need to add the following after the `builder.Services.AddFluentUIComponents();` line:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddDataGridEntityFrameworkAdapter();Copy
```

## Using the DataGrid component with OData

If you want to use the `FluentDataGrid` with data provided through OData, you need to install an additional package so the grid knows how to resolve queries asynchronously for efficiency.

### Installation
Install the package by running the command:

```cshtml
dotnet add package Microsoft.FluentUI.AspNetCore.Components.DataGrid.ODataAdapterCopy
```

### Usage
In your `Program.cs` file you need to add the following after the `builder.Services.AddFluentUIComponents();` line:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddDataGridODataAdapter();
```
