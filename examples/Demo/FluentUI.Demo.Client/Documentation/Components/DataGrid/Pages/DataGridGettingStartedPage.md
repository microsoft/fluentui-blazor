# Getting started

The example and code below show what you need to add to one of your Blazor page components to render a very simple grid (with sortable columns).

It also shows how you can add pagination to your grid. In fact there are two paginators used here. One at the top and one at the bottom of the grid. They automatically stay synchronized. The top paginator does not show the total count summary.
