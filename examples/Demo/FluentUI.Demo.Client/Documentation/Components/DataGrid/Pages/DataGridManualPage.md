# Manual grid

Although it is possible to create a data grid declaratively, we advise to not use this way of working with a DataGrid. Things like setting headers and specifying sorting are much harder and sometimes not possible to achieve. Best result will be achieved when using `DisplayMode="DataGridDisplayMode.Table"`.
