# Spinner

A **spinner** alerts a user that content is being loaded or processed and they should wait
for the activity to complete.

## Best practices

**Do**
- If your **FluentSpinner** is the only element on the page, set `tabIndex="0"` 
  on it to allow it to be picked up by screen readers.
- Use a **FluentSpinner** when a task is not immediate.
- Use one **FluentSpinner** at a time.
- Descriptive verbs are appropriate under a Spinner to help the user understand 
  what's happening. Ie: Saving, processing, updating
  (you can use a [FluentField](/Field)).
- Use a **FluentSpinner** when confirming a change has been made or a task is being processed.
- Add a description to a **FluentSpinner** when reduced-motion is active.

**Don't**
- Don't use a **FluentSpinner** when performing immediate tasks.
- Don't show multiple **FluentSpinner**s at the same time.
- Don't include more than a few words when paired with a **FluentSpinner**.
