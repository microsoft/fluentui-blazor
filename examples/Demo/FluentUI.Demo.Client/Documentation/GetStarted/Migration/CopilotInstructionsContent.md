To streamline your migration process, we provide custom instructions for GitHub Copilot in the `copilot-instructions.md` file. These instructions help Copilot understand our codebase conventions, naming patterns, and migration requirements.

By importing these custom instructions into your GitHub Copilot settings, you'll get more accurate and context-aware suggestions specifically tailored to FluentUI Blazor migration tasks.

Example benefits:
- Migrate complete file following new namespacing and new parameters
- Renaming old names from v3-v4 to v5

> ⚠️ Note
>
> - This feature is currently in public preview and is subject to change.
> - Custom instructions are currently only supported for **Copilot Chat** in **VS Code** and **Visual Studio**.

The complete documentation is available here [Adding custom instructions for GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot)

Once your migration is done, you can remove the file or the part of the FluentUI migration.
