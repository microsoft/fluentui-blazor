The component itself has been renamed from `FluentProgressRing` to `FluentSpinner`
to be coherent with the Web Components and React naming conventions.

> **Note:** The new component `FluentSpinner` cannot be paused. It must always be spinning.
> So, the `Paused`, `Min`, `Max`, `Value` properties has been removed.
