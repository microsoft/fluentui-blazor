<h1>FluentUI Blazor - Icons and Emoji Explorers</h1>

<p>
    The components, and icons that are used by the library itself, are still part of the package.
    Adding the <code>Microsoft.FluentUI.AspNetCore.Components.Icons</code> and
    <code>Microsoft.FluentUI.AspNetCore.Components.Emoji</code> packages is enough to make the resources
    available to your code.
</p>

<p>
    We use the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/host-and-deploy/configure-trimmer">.NET trimming</a>
    capabilities to publish only those assests that are actually being used in your program.
    Usually this results in some very small DLL's that only contain the resources that are
    actually being used in your application.
</p>
<p>
    We support the complete
    <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-system-icons">Fluent UI System Icons</a> and
    <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-emoji">Fluent Emoji collections</a>.
