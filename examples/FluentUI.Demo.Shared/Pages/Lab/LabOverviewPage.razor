    <h1>Incubation Lab Overview</h1>
</div>

<p>
    The incubation lab is were we test things out. Some of the expirements might make it into the library, others are offered here to copy 
    them to your project in an easy way. Some might even end up in the trashcan.
</p>
<p>
    As these components are not part of the official library, they are not included in the NuGet package. Also, please note that we only 
    offer support for these specific components through the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/fast-blazor/">GitHub repository</a> on a best effort base.
    <br />
    We hope you will help us test-drive the components, both here in the demo environment but also in your own projects, and give us 
    feedback (at our <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/fast-blazor/discussions">repo's discussion board'</a>).
</p>
<p>
    Most components will show download links for the Razor (<code>.razor</code>), C# (<code>.cs</code>), CSS (<code>.css</code>) and JavaScript 
    (<code>.js</code>) files (if applicable for that specific component). This makes it easy to test the components inside your own projects.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Please be aware that if you download the files to use in your own projects, you need to replace the <code>FluentUI.Demo.Shared</code> namespace with your own project's namespace</strong>
</p>
<p class="small">Inspiration (and large parts of the implementations) for some of these compoments comes from an interal Microsoft project and contributor. Many thanks!</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
 
<DemoSection Component="typeof(LayoutExample)" Title="Putting it all together">
    <Description>
        This demo show a number of the lab components working together. More specifically the following components:
        <ul>
            <li><FluentAnchor Appearance=Appearance.Hypertext Href="/Lab/Layout">Layout</FluentAnchor></li>
            <li><FluentAnchor Appearance=Appearance.Hypertext Href="/Lab/Stack">Stack</FluentAnchor></li>
            <li><FluentAnchor Appearance=Appearance.Hypertext Href="/Lab/NavMenu">NavMenu, NavMenuGroup and NavMenuLink</FluentAnchor></li>
            <li><FluentAnchor Appearance=Appearance.Hypertext Href="/Lab/Header">Header</FluentAnchor></li>
            <li><FluentAnchor Appearance=Appearance.Hypertext Href="/Lab/BodyContent">BodyContent</FluentAnchor></li>
            <li><FluentAnchor Appearance=Appearance.Hypertext Href="/Lab/Footer">Footer</FluentAnchor></li>
        </ul>
        The switches on top allow you to easily turn on/off the individual components and see the effect of that.
        <br />
        <br />
        The components use sensible default regarding margins, padding, etc. This should make it easy to implement them in your own projects 
        without you needing to do a lot of CSS adjustments.
        <p>If you want to use this example in your own project, you can download the <code>.razor</code> file below. To end up with working situation, you also need to download the files for all the other components mentioned above.</p>
