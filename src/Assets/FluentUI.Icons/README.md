## Introduction

The [Microsoft.FluentUI.AspNetCore](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-blazor) family of packages provides
a set of [Blazor](https://blazor.net) components and utilites which you can use to build applications
that have the look and feel or modern Microsoft applications.

This package contains libraries of icons wrapping Microsoftâ€™s official [Fluent UI System Icons library](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-system-icons).

## Getting Started

To get started using the Fluent UI Icons in your Blazor applications, you will first need 
to install the official [Nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.FluentUI.AspNetCore.Components.Icons/)
in the project you would like to use the library and components. You can use the following command:

```shell
dotnet add package Microsoft.FluentUI.AspNetCore.Components.Icons
```

## Usage

To use the icons, you will need to add the following using statement to your `_Imports.razor` file:

```razor
@using Icons = Microsoft.FluentUI.AspNetCore.Components.Icons
```

Then you can use the icons in your Blazor components like this:

```razor
<FluentIcon Icon="@(Icons.Regular.Size24.Save)" />
```

> **Note:** Names are structured as follows: `Icons.[IconVariant].[IconSize].[IconName]`.

You can use your custom images by setting the `Value` property calling the `Icon.FromImageUrl` method:

```razor
<FluentIcon Value="@(Icon.FromImageUrl("/Blazor.png"))" Width="32px" />
```

## List of icons and additional resources
