// One awkwardness of the way FluentDataGrid collects its list of child columns is that, during OnParametersSetAsync,
// it only knows about the set of columns that were present on the *previous* render. If it's going to trigger a
// data load during OnParametersSetAsync, that operation can't depend on the current set of columns as it might
// have changed, or might even still be empty (i.e., on the first render).
//
// Ways this could be resolved:
//
// - In the future, we could implement the long-wanted feature of being able to query the contents of a RenderFragment
//   separately from rendering. Then the whole trick of collection-during-rendering would not be needed.
// - Or, we could factor out most of FluentDataGrid's internals into some new component FluentDataGridCore. The parent component,
//   FluentDataGrid, would then only be responsible for collecting columns followed by rendering FluentDataGridCore. So each time
//   FluentDataGridCore renders, we'd already have the latest set of columns
//    - Drawback: since FluentDataGrid has public API, it's much messier to have to forward all of that to some new child type.
//    - However, this is arguably the most correct solution in general (at least until option 1 above is implemented)
// - Or, we could decide it's enough to fix this on the first render (since that's the only time we're going to guarantee
//   to apply a default sort order), and then as a special case put in some extra component in the render flow that raises
//   an event once the columns are first collected.
//    - This is relatively simple and non-disruptive, though it doesn't cover cases where queries need to be delayed until
//      after a dynamically-added column is added
//
// The final option is what's implemented here. We send the notification via EventCallbackSubscribable so that the async
// operation and re-rendering follows normal semantics without us having to call StateHasChanged or think about exceptions.
