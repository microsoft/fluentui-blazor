# FluentField

The `FluentField` component is a wrapper around a input component that add a label and a message to the input.

## Usage

You can use it by enclosing your component in a FluentField like this.
You need to specify the `ForId`, `Class` and `Style` properties for the component to work correctly.

The `@Id` property does not have to be defined when you create your component,
it is automatically generated by the `FluentField` component.

```razor
<FluentField InputComponent="@this" ForId="@Id" Class="@ClassValue" Style="@StyleValue">
    <!-- Your input component here -->
</FluentField>
```

As the `ClassValue` and `StyleValue` attributes are added to the FluentField, you don't need to add them to your input component.

## Example

See FluentTextField for an example.
